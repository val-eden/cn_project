<h1>What makes a good full suspension bike?</h1>
<p>Full suspension mountain bikes make rough trails feel smoother and help you to push your limits when the going gets tough. If you want to ride more challenging mountain bike trails a full suspension MTB is what you need. A trail full sus MTB with 120 - 150mm of travel is ideal for most people. A cross-country full suspension bike has less travel but will be lighter and faster on smooth tracks. Longer travel enduro and DH full suspension MTBs are best for hard-hitting downhill trails. A women’s full sus MTB has women’s specific components with a similar amount of travel as a men’s full sus bike.</p>
