<h1>Hardtail vs Full-sus: Which is best for you?</h1>
<p>THE biggest decision to make when buying a new mountain bike is whether to go for a hardtail or full suspension MTB. 
    Hardtails are the simplest form of mountain bike. They have a suspension fork for the front wheel while the rear wheel is attached securely to the frame. 
    Full suspension or full sus bikes are a little more complicated. As the name suggests, these bikes have suspension for the rear wheel as well as a suspension fork for the front.

<h2>What is an entry-level bike?</h2>
<p>Entry level mountain bikes are all hardtails while you will find mostly full sus MTBs at the top end. <br> In the middle you have the choice of both types. It is between the £1,000 and £2,000 mark where you will find the bikes evenly split between hardtail and full suspension bikes. 
    These are mostly trail or XC MTBs that are ideal for riding trail centres as well as cross-country tracks.
